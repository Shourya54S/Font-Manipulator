<h3 id = "Purpose">In Many schools, students did not like reading the notice board and usually missed the important messages which the school had to convey. So some students decided to create a fun notice board for the students where a student can increase or decrease the font size. If they can't view the notice written in small letters they can use their wrists to increase the font and read the notice.</h3>
